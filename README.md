# MERIT

We provide the MERIT algorithm for condition specific directed binding based gene regulatory network inference for metabolic pathways. 

The algorithm + a tutorial





For comparative network visualization, we use Cytoscape with the Dynet app. 

First download and install the Cytoscape.

Import multiple network files at once.
Live synchronisation of network layouts.
Highlight differences between two networks (based on node/edge presence or specific attribute).
Highlight most varying nodes/edges across multiple networks (based on node/edge presence or specific attribute).
Highlight most varying nodes in terms of their edge connections (most rewired nodes) across multiple networks.
Complex filtering criteria (e.g. show edges present in network A and B, but not C or D)
Create a networks vs edges heatmap, with hierarchical clustering on both axes (cluster edges that evolve similarly across multiple networks and cluster networks that contain similar connections).
